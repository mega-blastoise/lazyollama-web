## Opinions _(These are ours, if you like them, take them with you. If you don't, then you've equally grown, just in the other direction.)_

1. This project does not use a linter like eslint. When I was younger, and more venerable, I would have launched into a rant about how linting in the js ecosystem specifically is an anti DX construct, that maintain the effect of slowing down the competent javascript developer. I still hold that opinion, but I'm older and tired, so no rant.  
2. You only need to know about 5% of something to get started.
